AdjustAList
===========

Adjust-A-List is the easiest way to modify and create an existing Twitter's user list. Simply search for a Twitter user which will will surface all of their lists, then click on the list you'd like to edit and and then select users you like to follow from their list, and feel free to add your own (up to 100). The final result will be a brand new list that will be sent back to Twitter.

Enjoy!
